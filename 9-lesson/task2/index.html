                <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire
                    off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark
                    near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time,
                    like tears in rain... <em>Time to die.</em>
                </p>
                <p>I've seen things... seen things you little people wouldn't believe.
                    Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion bright as magnesium...
                    I rode on the back decks of a blinker and watched C-beams glitter
                    in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments... they'll be gone.
